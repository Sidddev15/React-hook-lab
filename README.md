# 🎯 React Mastery Roadmap (Oct–Dec 2025)

Welcome to the **React Mastery Journey** — a hands-on roadmap designed to build real, production-ready skills with **React + TypeScript**.  
By the end of this program, you’ll have developed a deep understanding of hooks, routing, forms, server state management, and performance optimization — all while building practical mini-apps.

## 🧩 Stack Used

- **Framework:** React (with TypeScript)
- **Tooling:** Vite, React Router, TanStack Query, React Hook Form + Zod
- **State Management:** Zustand / Redux Toolkit
- **UI:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library

## 📚 Learning Phases

### **Phase 1 — React Foundations (Oct–Nov 2025)**

1. **Hooks Deep Dive**
   - useState, useEffect (cleanup, deps)
   - useRef (DOM, timers)
   - useMemo, useCallback (optimization)
   - Custom hooks (debounce, localStorage, network status)
2. **Routing & Navigation**
   - Nested layouts, params, and guards
   - Protected routes and lazy loading
3. **Server State Management**
   - TanStack Query for fetching, caching, and mutations
   - Error handling, optimistic updates
4. **Forms & Validation**
   - React Hook Form + Zod schema validation
   - Dynamic fields and form submission workflows

---

### **Phase 2 — React Advanced (Dec 2025–Jan 2026)**

1. **Global State**
   - Zustand / Redux Toolkit patterns
2. **Data-Heavy UIs**
   - TanStack Table (pagination, filters, sorting)
3. **Testing & Accessibility**
   - Unit / Integration tests with Vitest + RTL
   - a11y best practices and aria usage
4. **Animation & UX Polish**
   - Framer Motion transitions, modals, and micro-interactions

## 🧠 What You’ll Be Able to Do After Completion

✅ **Build production-grade React apps** with clean TypeScript and modular architecture.  
✅ **Design reusable hooks** and manage both client and server state effectively.  
✅ **Implement modern routing and lazy loading** with nested layouts and guards.  
✅ **Create robust, validated forms** using React Hook Form + Zod.  
✅ **Optimize performance** with memoization and derived state.  
✅ **Test and debug React apps** using Vitest and React Testing Library.  
✅ **Deliver accessible and animated UIs** using Tailwind + Framer Motion.  
✅ **Think like a professional React engineer** ready for SDE-2 level projects and SaaS dashboards.
